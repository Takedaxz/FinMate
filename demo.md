### AI Analysis (60 seconds)
"Now I'll trigger the AI analysis. Behind the scenes, FinMate is:
- Fetching real-time market data from Alpha Vantage
- Calculating portfolio metrics like weights and P&L
- Using Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3 Sonnet for reasoning
- Generating personalized recommendations

The AI has identified several risk flags and is suggesting diversification strategies based on the portfolio's current sector concentration."

### Report Generation (30 seconds)
"FinMate generates a comprehensive HTML report with interactive charts and professional formatting. The report includes portfolio metrics, sector exposure, risk analysis, and actionable recommendations - all with proper disclaimers."

### Autonomous Operation (30 seconds)
"One of FinMate's key features is autonomous operation. I can trigger the daily check manually to show how it runs without user input, analyzing the portfolio and generating a summary report automatically."
